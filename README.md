# Jackdaw

A Common Lisp framework for defining discrete dynamic Bayesian networks with deterministic constraints with very little coding.

The formalities underlying this framework are described in chapter three of my [PhD thesis](https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=dd3e25aa-6006-486e-afcf-c0692e0afacd).

An introductory tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/experiencedlisteners/jackdaw-tutorial).

Examples of jackdaw models can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/experiencedlisteners/jackdaw-models).
